# Calculator
The Python-based calculator features three distinct modes: normal calculation, matrix operations, and vector functions. In normal calculation mode, it performs algebraic calculations and solves equations. The matrix mode allows for matrix manipulation, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, transpose, power, determinant, adjoin, inverse, conversion to row echelon form, and reduced row echelon form, as well as rank determination. Additionally, the vector mode supports vector operations such as addition, subtraction, dot product, cross product, scalar triple product, and unit vector computation. The user interface is developed using the Tkinter library.
The executable file is also included in the repository.
